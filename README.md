QtNote
======
It's just very small Qt app which usually lives in your system tray and allows you to make notes quick way.

QtNote was written as a clone of Tomboy with use of Qt.
It's not so feature rich as Tomboy but light and fast and usually suits all common needs.
Moreover QtNote can work with Tomboy notes and it's not so hard add support of other apps.

Some features:
* Quick access to notes from tray menu
* Internal notes manager to handle multiple notes at once
* Support for Tomboy notes
* Create notes from selection by hotkey (X11 only)
* Crossplatform (tested on linux and windows with gcc and Visual C)
* Other: configurable amount of notes in menu. configurable storage path, print note, save note dialog geometry

Development:
You can try to start qmake in development mode.

  qmake CONFIG+=devel

this mode forces plugins loader to use application directory to load plugins.

Deployment:
Look at common.pri. It contains some variables you may need to redefine, like PREFIX, LIBDIR and others.
So just pass this variables to qmake:

  qmake PREFIX=/usr


=== Windows ===
The build was last tested with mingw which supplied by qt-5.5 installer.
But previously it was also compilable with msvc.
Find msvc project file in the root directory. Probably it's a little outdeated for now
and should be regenerated by vs qt addon.

Spellchecker plugin on Windows
Set HUNSPELL_DIR or (HUNSPELL_LIB and HUNSPELL_INC) to let qtnote find hunspell

Deployment on Windows
For windows we have another useful variable WININST_PREFIX.
When it's set "make install" will recreate directory/files structure in given prefix suitable for distribution.
